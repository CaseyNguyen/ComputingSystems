vaccines.cpp
(Note: It is necessary to have access to the CS1 server in order for this program to work.)
To compile: g++ vaccines.cpp -std=c++11 -lpthread -o vaccines
To execute: ./vaccines

social_distancing.cpp
To compile: g++ social_distancing.cpp -std=c++11 -lpthread -o social_distancing
Given that x is an integer amount of vaccinated kids and y is an integer amount of unvaccinated kids...
To execute: ./social_distancing x y
(Note: This program will fail to execute if there are not three arguments provided OR either x or y are non-integer values.)

Provided in the .zip file are also .txt versions of vaccines.cpp and social_distancing.cpp, should there be a problem opening them.
